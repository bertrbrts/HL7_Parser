An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field, indicates that the resource is required at the start date/time of the appointment.A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the resource is required after the appointment's start date/time.  Specifying a negative offset indicates that the resource is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment.  Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment's start date/time.This field is conditionally required.  If a value for AIG-8-Start Date/Time is not provided, then a value is required for this field.  To specify that there is no difference between the appointment's start date/time and the resource's start date/time either replicate the appointment's start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in AIG-9-Start Date/Time Offset and any valid time unit code in AIG10-Start Date/Time Offset Units.
