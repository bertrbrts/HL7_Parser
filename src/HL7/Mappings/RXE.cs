The pharmacy or treatment department has the "authority" (and/or necessity) to schedule dispense/give events. Hence, the pharmacy or treatment department has the responsibility to encode this scheduling information in RXE-1-quantity/timing and RXG-3-quantity/timing. ORC-7-quantity/timing does not change it always specifies the requested give/dispense schedule of the original order.

In the RXE segment, this give code must be fully encoded.  The dispense fields, which define the units and amount of what is to be issued to the patient (see RXE-10-dispense amount and RXE-11-dispense units below) do not necessarily correlate with the instructions of what amount is to be "given" or administered with each dose, and may or may not be specified with the order.  For example, the "give" part of the order may convey the field-representation of give 250 mg of Ampicillin, while the request to dispense part of the order may convey issue 30 tablets of generic equivalent for this outpatient prescription.The coding system used is conditional on both the nature of the medical substance or treatment ordered and site-specific implementation considerations.
