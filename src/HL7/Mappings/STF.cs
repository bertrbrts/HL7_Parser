In a network environment, this segment can be used to define personnel to other applications, for example, order entry clerks, insurance verification clerks, admission clerks, as well as provider demographics. When using the STF and PRA segments in the Staff/Practitioner Master File message, MFE-4-primary key value is used to link all the segments pertaining to the same master file entry.  Therefore, in the MFE segment, MFE-4-primary key value must be filled in.  Other segments may follow the STF segment to provide data for a particular type of staff member. The PRA segment (practitioner) is one such.  It may optionally follow the STF segment in order to add practitioner-specific data. Other segments may be defined as needed. When using the segments included in this chapter for other then Staff/Practitioner Master File messages, disregard references to MFE-4 - primary key value.

For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1.

On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed.If the encoding component ED.4 does not equal "A", then, after encoding, the (encoded) data must be scanned for HL7 delimiter characters, and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences. Only then can the component be added to the HL7 segment/message. On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed out of the message before being decoded. This can be expressed as "encode", "escape", "parse", "de-escape" or "decode".
