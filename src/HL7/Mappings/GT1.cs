This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.
