		/// The MRG segment provides receiving applications with information necessary to initiate the merging of patient data as well as groups of records. It is intended that this segment be used throughout the Standard to allow the merging of registration, accounting, and clinical records within specific applications.The assigning authority, the fourth component of the patient identifiers, is an HD data type that is uniquely associated with the assigning authority that originally assigned the number. A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers. The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists. Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as those of the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH. The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site. This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.Example 1 Identifier plus Visa yields a unique identifier.Example 2 identifier plus state plus DLN yields a unique drivers license number.Example 3 identifier plus country plus INS yields a unique immigration number.The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

Its use is reserved for instances in which the nickname is a single name part that is provided in addition to a name that has some other type, such as legal. It is understood that the "called by" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.Examples - James Robert Smith is Called By Jim Bob - James Robert Smith is Called By JR - Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard - Mary Margaret Elizabeth Jones is Called By Meg.
