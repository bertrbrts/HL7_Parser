		/// The Common Order segment (ORC) is used to transmit fields that are common to all orders (all types of services that are requested).There is some overlap between fields of the ORC and those in the order detail segments. These are described in the succeeding sections.ORC use notesa) placer order groupsThe Standard supports a mechanism to collect several orders together in a group. Most often this is used to represent an "ordering session" for a single patient.An order group is a list of orders (ORCs) associated with an ORC-4-placer group number. A group is established when the placer supplies a placer group number with the original order. The order group consists of all the ORCs and order detail segments that have the same placer group number. Orders can be removed from the group using cancel, or added using the replacement or parent-child mechanisms. New orders cannot otherwise be added to the group.b) duplicate fieldsThe ORC is intended to uniformly define the fields that are common to all orders (i.e., requested services). Some ORC fields are duplicated in some order detail segments (e.g., OBR, RXO). For example, ORC-2-placer order number has the same meaning and purpose as OBR-2-placer order number field. This promotes upward compatibility with past versions and ASTM.The rule for using these fields is that the value must appear in the order detail segment if it does not appear in the ORC. However, it is recommended to transmit the field value in both places to avoid confusion.c) parent/child  cancel, hold, discontinueDuring transmission of a request to cancel, hold, or discontinue a parent order, the request is intended to apply recursively to the parent order and all associated child orders.For example   1) An EKG application receives an order for three EKGs on successive mornings.   2) The EKG application creates three child orders, one for each requested EKG.   3) The first daily EKG has already been performed when a request is received to cancel the original parent order. (The parent is beyond the point of cancellation.)   4) The remaining, unperformed, children are canceled as a result of the request.

			/// ORC.1 - Determines the function of the order segment. Refer to HL7 Table 0119  Order Control Codes for valid entries. Depending on the message, the action of the control code may refer to an order or an individual service. For example, the code CA in an OMP message cancels the order. The same code in an RDS message, cancels the dispense. Very detailed explanatory notes are given at the end of this section.This field may be considered the "trigger event" identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories a) event request  Codes like "NW" (new order) and "CA" (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event . b) event acknowledgment  Codes like "OK" (order accepted) and "CR" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request . c) event notification  Codes like "OC" (order canceled) and "OD" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary.Event request codes are intended to initiate an event. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event. Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know.Fillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event  notification-type trigger events interchangeably. However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA).Refer to Chapter 2C, Code Tables, "HL7 Table 0119  Order Control Codes".

			/// ORC.2 - This field is the placer application's order number.This field is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (See Section 2.A.28, "EI  Entity Identifier"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, "HD  Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique) a) in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement b) in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders) and c) in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number).See the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases.The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).ORC-2-placer order number is the same as OBR-2-placer order number. If the placer order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR and vice versa. If both fields, ORC-2-placer order number and OBR-2-placer order number are valued, they must contain the same value. When results are transmitted in an ORU message, an ORC is not required, and the identifying placer order number must be present in the OBR segments.These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).

			/// ORC.3 - This field is the order number associated with the filling application. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (Section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filler (receiving) application. This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see Section 2.A.36, "HD  hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third- party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the filler application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).ORC-3-filler order number is the same as OBR-3-filler order number. If the filler order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR. (This rule is the same for other identical fields in the ORC and OBR and promotes upward and ASTM compatibility.) This is particularly important when results are transmitted in an ORU message. In this case, the ORC is not required and the identifying filler order number must be present in the OBR segments.The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.

The ORC-5-Order status indicates IP and the ORC-25-Order status modifier would indicate a disconnected status. A third example involves pharmacy dispenses.

It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1.
