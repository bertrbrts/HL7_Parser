User-defined Table 0363  Assigning Authority is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for the first sub-component of the HD component, namespace ID.As of v 2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional. It is required if XCN.1 is populated and neither XCN.22 nor XCN.23 are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.The reader is referred to XCN.22 and XCN.23 if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued.  If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in XCN.22 and/or XCN.23 conflict with XCN.9, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.Note When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.By site agreement, implementors may continue to use User-defined Table 0300  Namespace ID for the first sub-component.
