Examples of treatments products include medications and certain devices or supplies, e.g., inhaler spacers, blood glucose monitors, syringes, infusion sets, which might require prescription.Often the coded entry implies dosage form and a dosage form is required in addition to the product name. When the give code does not include the dosage form, use RXO-5-requested dosage form. When the give code does not include the strength, use RXO-18-requested give strength and the RXO-19-requested give units. Realize that strengths do not apply to some such orders.The RXO-1, RXO-2 and RXO-4 are mandatory unless the prescription/treatment is transmitted as free text using RXO-6 then RXO-1, RXO-2, and RXO-4 may be blank and the first subcomponent of RXO-6 must be blank.Use of the RXO-6.2 versus the RXO-1.2 for a free text order is dependent on whether or not the free text describes a product or if it is more commentary in nature.Please refer to the request to-dispense fields RXO-10, RXO-11, and RXO-12 for a discussion of the interrelationship with the request-to-give fields.

This is the numeric part of the strength, used in combination with RXO-19-requested give strength units.The need for strength and strength unit fields in addition to the amount and amount units fields included in various RX_ segments requires explanation. Physicians can write a prescription for a drug such as Ampicillin in two ways. One way would be "Ampicillin 250 mg capsules, 2 capsules four times a day."  In this case the give amount would be 2, the give units would be capsules, the strength would be 250 and the strength units would milligrams.However, the provider could also write the pharmaceutical treatment as "Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day."  In this case the give amount would be 500 and the give units would be milligrams.  The strength would not be reported in the RXO segment because it is not specified the drug could be given in two 250 mg caps or one 500 mg cap. But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which capsule size was dispensed.Some coding systems imply the strength, units, route of administration, and manufacturer of substances within a single instructional code.  NDC codes, for example, usually imply not only the medical substance, but also the strength, the units, and the form, e.g., 0047-0402-30Ampicillin 250 MG CAPSNDC.  So all of this information can also be completely specified in RXO-1-requested give code and in the analogous CE fields in other pharmacy/treatment segments.
