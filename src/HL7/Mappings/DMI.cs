It belongs conceptually to components 1-3 and appears here only for reasons of backward compatibility.Usage Note If the coding system is any system other than an "HL7 coding system," version ID must be valued with an actual version ID. If the coding system is "HL7 coding system," version ID may have an actual value or it may be absent. If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header. Text description of code is optional but its use should be encouraged since it makes messages easier to review for accuracy, especially during interface testing and debugging.
