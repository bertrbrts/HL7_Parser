After the request has been assigned to one or more slots however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see sections 10.6.1.1, "ARQ-1   Placer Appointment ID   (EI)   00860," and 10.6.1.2, "ARQ-2   Filler Appointment ID   (EI)   00861)."  This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application.  This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too.  As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID.  This can be done either by prefixing the appointment ID with the schedule ID, or by appending the schedule ID to the appointment ID.

Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier.As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.Usage Note The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states "Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.

The first component contains the earliest date and time that the appointment may be scheduled to begin.  The second component contains the latest date and time that the appointment may be scheduled to begin.The DTM (time stamp) data type allows for two components the time stamp, and a degree of precision.  If used, the degree of precision should be separated from the time stamp by a subcomponent delimiter.If only the range start date/time has been provided, then the range end date/time is assumed to be infinity.  Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the next available slot on/after a particular date and time.  If only the range end date/time has been provided, then the range start date/time is assumed to be immediate.  Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the appointment start some time between the current date and time, and the specified range end date/time.  Requesting an appointment when the range start and range end date/time are the same is equivalent to requesting a specific slot on a schedule.  If this field is unvalued, then the filler application will assume that the next available slot should be scheduled, using the institution's processing rules for scheduling appointments.This field may repeat.  Repetitions of this field are used to construct a list of acceptable ranges.  Repetitions of this field are connected with a logical OR to construct this list.  This procedure allows applications to provide multiple preferences for the scheduling of appointments.  Applications should take steps to ensure that nonsensical ranges are not indicated in this field (for example, redundant ranges).ExamplesSchedule the appointment to begin at some time between 800AM on Tuesday, May 17th, 1994 and 1200PM on Friday, May 20th, 1994 local timeSchedule the appointment in the next available slot on/after 600AM on Monday, April 25th, 1994 local timeSchedule the appointment in the next available slot on/before 600AM on Monday, April 25th, 1994 local timeSchedule the appointment in the next available slotSchedule the appointment to begin on any weekday during the two weeks beginning Monday, April 4th, 1994.  In this example, the degree of precision (sub)component of the time stamp is used to indicate that the date/time ranges refer to the institution's standard operating daySchedule the appointment in the next available slot that does not occur during the May 1994 HL7 Working Group MeetingSchedule the appointment to begin on/before 400PM on Thursday, December 23rd, 1993, or any weekday between Monday, December 27th, and Thursday, December 30th, or on/after 800AM on Monday, January 3rd, 1994

Usage Notes The Alternate Identifier is used to represent the local or user seen code as described. If present, it obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for component 1. If both are present, the identifiers in component 4 and component 1 should have exactly the same meaning, i.e., they should be exact synonyms.
